4. **Frontend** → 🔄 Next up: React patterns and API integration
5. **PWA** → Coming: Modern web app features
6. **Deployment** → Coming: Production deployment

## Tips for Learning

- **Don't skip phases**: Each builds on the previous
- **Test as you go**: Don't wait until the end to test
- **Read AWS docs**: When stuck, check official documentation
- **Experiment**: Try variations to understand why things work
- **Take notes**: Document what you learn in each phase
- **Ask questions**: Use me to explain concepts, not just fix code

## When to Ask for Help

- **Stuck for >30 minutes**: Ask for guidance or explanation
- **Errors you don't understand**: Share the error, I'll help debug
- **Concept confusion**: Ask "how does X work?" or "why do we do Y?"
- **Architecture questions**: "Should I use X or Y approach?"

Good luck! 🚀
